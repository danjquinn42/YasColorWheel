# Yas Color Wheel!
The Yas Color Wheel is a simple-to-use plugin for your webpage. Download colorwheel.js, add it to your project, and insert the <color-picker> tag in your HTML. Details below.

##Getting Started
1) Download colorwheel.js and put it in the script file of your own project.

2) Add the javascript file to your webpage using the <script> tag. If you are using a bundler like webpack you can skip this step.

3) Add <color-picker></color-picker> tag to your document

Now you should have a color wheel and lightness slider on your page with default styles applied. You can position and arrange the entire element by adding css to the color-picker tag.
